# MIPS-Simulator

A simple MIPS Simulator that can simulate MIPS execution for a small subset of instructions under certain constraints.

The following instructions are supported: add, addi, mult, sub, beq, bne, lw, sw, sll, j, and halt. The program terminates when the halt instruction is encountered.

# Setup

All you need is Python 2.

# Usage

To load the instructions, use the following command:

```
python InterpretingInput.py instructions
```

To run the simulator, use the following command:

```
python Main.py# Mips-Simulator
```
